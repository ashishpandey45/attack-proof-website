## ATTACK-PROOF WEBSITE WITH AUTOMATED BACKUP OF OS AND LOGS

The “Atack-Proof Website with Automated Backup of OS and Logs” project successfully implements several security measure and configura􀆟ons to enhance the website’s security and resilience. By isola􀆟ng components, automa􀆟ng backups, implemen􀆟ng autoscaling, managing log reten􀆟on, and taking regular OS disk snapshots, the project reduces the risk of atacks, improves system availability, and ensures data integrity.
The project's isolated environment provides containment, limi􀆟ng the impact of poten􀆟al breaches. Automated backups through the synchroniza􀆟on of logs and webpages to the S3 bucket guarantee the ability to recover cri􀆟cal data in the event of atacks or system failures.
Autoscaling, coupled with the load balancer, ensures op􀆟mal performance during peak traffic, preven􀆟ng poten􀆟al atacks due to resource exhaus􀆟on.
The bucket lifecycle policy efficiently manages log reten􀆟on, op􀆟mizing storage costs and maintaining a manageable log history. SNS no􀆟fica􀆟ons keep administrators informed about instances increasing or decreasing, enabling 􀆟mely ac􀆟ons and efficient capacity management. Furthermore, the regular snapshots of the OS disk provide a reliable restore point, enabling the restora􀆟on of the instance to a known secure state in case of atacks or system failures.
While the implemented security measures greatly enhance the website's protec􀆟on against atacks, it is important to note that achieving absolute "atack-proof" status is challenging. Ongoing security prac􀆟ces such as regular updates, strong access controls, and comprehensive tes􀆟ng should be employed to maintain a robust security posture.
Overall, the "Atack-Proof Website with Automated Backup of OS and Logs" project successfully combines various security features and configura􀆟ons to create a resilient and secure website infrastructure. By incorpora􀆟ng these measures, the project ensures that the website remains available, protected, and resilient against poten􀆟al atacks.
