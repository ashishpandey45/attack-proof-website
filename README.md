## ATTACK-PROOF WEBSITE WITH AUTOMATED BACKUP OF OS AND LOGS

The “Atack-Proof Website with Automated Backup of OS and Logs” project successfully implements several security measure and configura􀆟ons to enhance the website’s security and resilience. By isolating components, automating backups, implementing autoscaling, managing log retention, and taking regular OS disk snapshots, the project reduces the risk of atacks, improves system availability, and ensures data integrity.

The project's isolated environment provides containment, limiting the impact of potential breaches. Automated backups through the synchronization of logs and webpages to the S3 bucket guarantee the ability to recover critical data in the event of atacks or system failures.

Autoscaling, coupled with the load balancer, ensures optimal performance during peak traffic, preventing potential atacks due to resource exhaustion.

The bucket lifecycle policy efficiently manages log reten􀆟on, op􀆟mizing storage costs and maintaining a manageable log history. SNS notifications keep administrators informed about instances increasing or decreasing, enabling 􀆟mely actions and efficient capacity management.

Furthermore, the regular snapshots of the OS disk provide a reliable restore point, enabling the restoration of the instance to a known secure state in case of atacks or system failures.

While the implemented security measures greatly enhance the website's protection against atacks, it is important to note that achieving absolute "atack-proof" status is challenging. Ongoing security prac􀆟ces such as regular updates, strong access controls, and comprehensive testing should be employed to maintain a robust security posture.

Overall, the "Atack-Proof Website with Automated Backup of OS and Logs" project successfully combines various security features and configurations to create a resilient and secure website infrastructure. By incorporating these measures, the project ensures that the website remains available, protected, and resilient against poten􀆟al atacks.
